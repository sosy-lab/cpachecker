# This configuration runs the following 2 algorithms in parallel:
# 1. Interpolation-based Model Checking (with additional induction check)
# 2. Continuously-refined invariant generation using a data-flow analysis
#    over an interval-based abstract domain.
# The invariants generated by 2. are injected into SMT queries of 1.
# The verdict returned by the invariant generator is ignored, i.e. the
# process continues even if it has proven the program safe.
