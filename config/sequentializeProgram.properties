# This configuration creates a sequentialization (= equivalent,  nondeterministic,
# sequential  program) of a concurrent C program that can be given to sequential
# analysis algorithms. The implementation features a Modular Partial Order
# Reduction (MPOR) approach that encodes information about memory location
# accesses by threads inside the output program which can be enabled via options.

analysis.preprocessing.MPOR.runAnalysis = false

# The config needs at least one CPA, otherwise CPAchecker throws.
# This is not handled in CoreComponentsFactory because 'runAnalysis' is not a field in that class.
# The information whether this config uses a CPA is thus not known in CoreComponentsFactory, and it
# cannot be handled there.
