This directory contains unmaintained configuration files for CPAchecker.

All configurations in this directory can be used with a shortcut on the command line:
Instead of `-config config/unmaintained/foo.properties` one can simply write `-foo`.

The configurations in this directory are possibly outdated, might not work correctly and
will potentially not be updated in the future if some other part of CPAchecker is changed.
