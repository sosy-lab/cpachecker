# The analyses used for MemSafety properties per default.
# Latest SV-COMP config without time-limits and continue after infeasible counterexample.
# 1: Normal SMG with symbolic execution and linked-list abstraction.
# 2: (1) with concrete assignments of symbolic offsets and sizes, 
#      stops for to many concrete assignments automatically.
# 3: SMG-Value analysis w CEX based on (1) that abstracts all concrete values saved in the SMG.
# 4: SMG-Value analysis w CEX based on (1).
# 5: SMG-SymEx overapproximating symbolic offsets and sizes w CEX based on (1).
