# The analyses used for memory-safety and memory-cleanup properties.
# 1: Normal SMG with symbolic execution and linked-list abstraction, no time limit.
# 2: (1) with concrete assignments of symbolic offsets and sizes, 60s, 
#      stops for to many concrete assignments automatically.
# 3: 30s of SMG-Value analysis w CEX based on (1) that abstracts all concrete values saved in the SMG.
# 4: 45s of SMG-Value analysis w CEX based on (1).
# 5: 45s SMG-SymEx overapproximating symbolic offsets and sizes w CEX based on (1).
