# The first SMGValue instance overapproximated every concrete value into unknown as well
# The SMGValue analysis is very good for finding bugs and is accurate for deterministic programs without havoc.
# The SMG-SymEx following it is overapproximating to find bugs quickly, but is not precise.
# Both are CEX checked with regular SMG-SymEx.
