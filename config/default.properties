# This file provides a configuration of CPAchecker
# that should work reasonably well for a wide range of programs and properties.
# It uses
# - memory graphs for memory-safety properties,
# - predicate abstraction for overflow properties,
# - lasso-based analysis for termination properties,
# - BDDs for concurrent programs,
# - predicate abstraction and value analysis for recursive programs, and
# - k-induction for all other cases.
