# This configuration file uses a parallel portfolio of different 
# SMG-Analyses for ReachSafety/MemSafety/MemCleanup properties
# MemSafety/MemCleanup is modeled after the SV-COMP25 portfolio
# but without time-limits and no stop for analyses after a CEX is
# found to be infeasible.
# Warning: ReachSafety based properties are currently untested!
