// Configuration for incremental creation of light-weight invariants

// but can help other analyses) based on a data-flow analysis.
// This configuration is intended as helper for other analyses
// that can make use of such invariants.
// This configuration incrementally refines its precision
// until it can prove the program safe or it reaches the maximum precision.
