For benchmarking, it is recommended to use scripts/benchmark.py.
This script takes as input one or more XML files which specifiy the tool,
the resource limits, the tool configuration, the input programs
and the columns that should appear in the output table.
The scripts puts all the results into the test/results/ directory.
Commented examples for these XML files are given in
doc/examples/benchmark*.xml. Several useful benchmark configurations
are in test/test-sets/*.xml.

In order to combine the results from several benchmark runs into
a single table the script scripts/table-generator.xml can be used.
It also takes an XML file as input that gives the table configuration.
An example for such a file is docs/examples/table-generator.xml.

There are several CPAchecker options that are especially useful for benchmarks:

- output.disable=true
  This option disables all output files that would otherwise be
  generated by CPAchecker.

- statistics.memory=false
  This option disables the additional thread that is tracking
  the memory usage over time.

It is also recommended to disable assertion checking for benchmarks.
This can be done by removing "-ea" from the last line of scripts/cpa.sh
