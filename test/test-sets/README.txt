This directory contains test and benchmark suites
for various configurations of CPAchecker.
BenchExec (https://github.com/dbeyer/benchexec)
can be used to execute them.
The definition files assume that the directory "c"
of the SV-Benchmarks repository
(https://github.com/dbeyer/sv-benchmarks/tree/master/c)
is checked out in the directory "test/programs/benchmarks".

All files starting with "integration-" are used
by the continuous integration system of CPAchecker
(http://buildbot.sosy-lab.org/buildbot/waterfall).
