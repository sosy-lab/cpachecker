  <!--
    Search the CPAchecker output for some values.
    The <column> tag has the pattern as content,
    and the script will try to extract a numerical value from matching lines.
    "numberOfDigits" gives the number of digits after the decimal separator,
    "title" the name of the column in the table.
    Both attributes are optional.
    These tags are not necessary here,
    statistics can still be extracted after the benchmark run.
  <columns>
    <column title="total" numberOfDigits="1">time for CPAchecker</column>
    <column title="reached">reached set</column>

  <!--
    There are two more top-level tags that are used only when the VerifierCloud is used:

    <requiredfiles> can be used to specify additional files that are needed
    for executing the benchmark. The tag may contain a path to a file or directory
    that is transmitted to the worker. Wildcards, environment variables etc. are resolved.
    The tag may appear several times, and can be placed inside the <benchmark>,
    <rundefinition>, and <tasks> tags.

    <require> can be used to select a specific set of worker machines. The attributes
    "cpuModel" (giving a string that needs to be contained in the worker's CPU name),
    "cpuCores" (giving the minimal number of CPU cores), and
    "memory" (giving the minimal amount of memory in MB) can be specified (all optional).
    The tag may appear several times, but each attribute may appear at most once
    (so you can specify all attributes in a single tag or spread over several occurrences).
