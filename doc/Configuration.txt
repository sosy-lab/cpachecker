CPAchecker configuration
========================

Configuration of CPAchecker is done via command-line arguments and
configuration files.

Configuration files
-------------------
A configuration file specify a set of options in key=value format.
All valid configuration options and their default values
are listed in the file doc/ConfigurationOptions.txt.
In most cases, the standard configuration files
in the directory config/ should be sufficient.
A detailed format description can be found in the section below.


Command-line options
--------------------
Several configuration options can also be specified as command-line arguments.
If an option appears on the command line as well as in the configuration file,
the value from the command line overrides the one from the file.
The following command-line arguments are allowed:

-help			print list of command-line argumments and exit
-config <FILE>		sets configuration file name
-cmc <FILE>		enables conditional model checking and adds one configuration
-cpas <CPAS>		sets "cpa = cpa.composite.CompositeCPA" and "CompositeCPA.cpas = <CPAS>"
-spec <FILE>		sets "specification = <FILE>"
-outputpath <DIR>	sets "output.path = <DIR>"
-logfile <FILE>		sets "log.file = <FILE>"
-nolog			sets "log.level = OFF" and "log.consoleLevel = OFF"
-noout			sets "output.disable=true"
-stats			sets "statistics.print = true"
-entryfunction <FUNC>	sets "analysis.entryFunction = <FUNC>"
-cbmc			sets "analysis.checkCounterexamples = true"
-timelimit <TIME>	sets "limits.time.cpu = <TIME>"
-32			sets "analysis.machineModel = Linux32" (this is the default)
-64			sets "analysis.machineModel = Linux64"
-skipRecursion		sets "cpa.callstack.skipRecursion = true" and "analysis.summaryEdges = true"
-preprocess		sets "parser.usePreprocessor = true"
-java			sets "language = JAVA"
-setprop <KEY>=<VALUE>	sets any option: "KEY = VALUE"

The file doc/ConfigurationOptions.txt contains an explanation
of these options.
The arguments "-config config/CONFIGFILE.properties" can be
abbreviated to "-CONFIGFILE". In other words, if CPAchecker finds an
unknown command-line option, it checks if a file with this name
and the ending ".properties" exists in the directory "config"
and uses it as the configuration file.

For conditional model checking, use "-cmc" several times
with the configurations to use (they will be executed in the given order).
The "-config" flag is not needed in this case
(but may be given to define options for the global analysis).
A similar form of abbreviation can be used for "-cmc"
as described above for "-config":
"-cmc CONFIGFILE" is equivalent to "-cmc config/CONFIGFILE.properties".

Either "-help", "-config", "-cmc", or "-cpas" has to be specified.

All other arguments to CPAchecker are interpreted as code files that should be
analyzed (option analysis.programNames). However, currently only one such file may
be specified.

The usual command line for running CPAchecker is to specify a configuration file
(either with "-config FILE" or "-CONFIGFILE") and a program file. Examples:
scripts/cpa.sh -predicateAnalysis doc/examples/example.c
scripts/cpa.sh -config config/predicateAnalysis.properties doc/examples/example.c


Specifying the CPA(s)
---------------------
The CPA that CPAchecker uses is specified with the "cpa" option (default:
cpa.composite.CompositeCPA). The syntax of the value is "package.ClassName Alias",
where the alias is an optional unique identifier for this instance of the
CPA. Without an alias, the class name is used as identifier. Configuration
options that should be used for only one instance of a CPA can be prefixed
with "alias.". Their values override the options without this prefix.

If the package name starts with "org.sosy_lab.cpachecker.", this prefix can be
omitted.

Wrapper CPAs like ARGCPA and CompositeCPA take one option "cpa" or "cpas"
to specify the wrapped CPA, depending whether this CPA wraps one or
several other CPAs (the latter is only used for CompositeCPA). This option
has to be prefixed with the identifier of the CPA as described above.

A simple example (the first line could be ommitted as it's the default):
cpa = cpa.composite.CompositeCPA
CompositeCPA.cpas = cpa.location.LocationCPA, cpa.callstack.CallstackCPA, cpa.explicit.ExplicitCPA explicitCPA
explicitCPA.cpa.explicit.threshold = 10

A more complex example:
cpa = cpa.arg.ARGCPA arg
arg.cpa = cpa.composite.CompositeCPA composite
composite.cpas = cpa.location.LocationCPA, cpa.callstack.CallstackCPA, cpa.automaton.ObserverAutomatonCPA ErrorLocationAutomaton, cpa.predicate.PredicateCPA
ErrorLocationAutomaton.cpa.automaton.inputFile = config/specification/ErrorLocation.spc

Note that instead of manually specifying an ObserverAutomatonCPA, you can
use the option "specification". The following example is identical to the last one:

cpa = cpa.arg.ARGCPA arg
arg.cpa = cpa.composite.CompositeCPA composite
composite.cpas = cpa.location.LocationCPA, cpa.callstack.CallstackCPA, cpa.predicate.PredicateCPA
specification = config/specification/ErrorLocation.spc


Configuration file format
-------------------------
The configuration file format is a text-based format
that is inspired by Java property files and Windows "ini" files.
Each option is given on a separate line.
Whitespaces around the key and the value are ignored
(so "key=value" and " key = value " are the same).
Lines starting with "//" or "# " are comments.
If a line ends with a backslash ("\"),
the content of the next line is appended to the current line.
If an option supports multiple values, separate them with a comma
(optionally with whitespaces around the comma).

The format supports optional sections
which start with "[Section.Name]" on a separate line.
The key of all options inside a section will be prefixed
with "Section.Name." (note the leading dot).
Options before the first section header
and those in a section with an empty name ("[]")
will be used just with their regular names (without prefix).
The same section name can be used several times in a file.

Other configuration files can be included with "#include file".
Paths need to be relative to the file with the include statement,
or absolute.
Options from included files will be overwritten by options
with the same names in the including file,
no matter where the include statement is placed.
Sections of the including file have no effect on the treatment
of options in the included file, and vice versa.
