CPAchecker JSON API
===================
CPAchecker running on Google App Engine exposes a RESTful JSON API to create,
retrieve and delete tasks and other resources.

RESTful
-------
RESTful means that standard HTTP methods are used for CRUD operations on resources
and standard HTTP status codes are used to convey success/error states.

JSON format
----------
The JSON format (http://json.org/) is used for sending and retrieving data.
Therefore any requests must set the following HTTP headers to successfully use
the JSON API:
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json


General server errors
=====================
Sometimes the server cannot process a request and therefore returns a default
response according to the occurred error.

Over Quota
----------
The request cannot be processed because one or more resource have depleted their
respective quota.

503 Service unavailable
{
  "status" : "OVER_QUOTA"
  "statusMessage" : "A resource has been depleted and no more requests can be processed."
}


Timeout
-------
The request was aborted because it took to long to process it.

500 Internal Server Error
{
  "status" : "TIMEOUT",
  "statusMessage" : "The request was aborted because it took too long to service it."
}


JSON Endpoints
==============
The following endpoints are provided as an API. They are described by the HTTP
method they accept, their URI, their request and respond format and header values.
A description is provided and an example request/response JSON entity.

# POST /taskset
===============
Creates a new taskset.
A taskset is a collection of tasks that are bundled together e.g. by a benchmark or
a large verification run. It associates every task with a boolean marker that
indicates whether the task has been marked as processed or not. This can be used
by a client e.g. to track the retrieval of the outcome of a task. 

Response
-------
201 Created
Location: [URI of the created taskset resource]



# DELETE /taskset/{tasksetKey}
===============
Deletes the taskset with the key {tasksetKey}.
Does not delete any associated tasks. 

Response
-------
200 OK

Error
-----
400 Not Found



# POST /taskset/{tasksetKey}/tasks
==================================
Creates tasks and puts them into the taskset with the key {tasksetKey}.
For the exact JSON format of a task see "POST /tasks".
Every task takes an additional field with the name "identifier".
This field will be passed into the response together with the key of the created task.
This identifier can be used to associate the created task with an object on the client.
For example:
Request: { "programText" : "abc", "identifier" : "foo", ...}
Response: { "taskKey" : "foo" }

Request
-------
[ {...}, {...}, {...}, ...]

Response
--------
201 Created
