CPAchecker JSON API
===================
CPAchecker running on Google App Engine exposes a RESTful JSON API to create,
retrieve and delete jobs and other resources.

RESTful
-------
RESTful means that standard HTTP methods are used for CRUD operations on resources
and standard HTTP status codes are used to convey success/error states.

JSON format
----------
The JSON format (http://json.org/) is used for sending and retrieveing data.
Therefore any requests must set the following HTTP headers to successfully use
the JSON API:
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json


General server errors
=====================
Sometimes the server cannot process a request and therefore returns a default
response according to the occured error.

Over Quota
----------
The request cannot be processed because one or more resource have depleted their
respective quota.

503 Service unavailable
{
  "status" : "OVER_QUOTA"
  "statusMessage" : "A resource has been depleted and no more requests can be processed."
}


Timeout
-------
The request was aborted because it took to long to process it.

500 Internal Server Error
{
  "status" : "TIMEOUT",
  "statusMessage" : "The request was aborted because it took too long to service it."
}

The following endpoints are provided as an API. They are described by the HTTP
method they accept, their URI, their request and respond format and header values.
A description is provided and an example request/response JSON entity.
