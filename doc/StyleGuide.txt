Style & Coding Guide
====================

If not explicitly stated here otherwise, the standard Java Coding Conventions apply:
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/codeconvtoc-136057.html

Further guidelines that are very worth reading:
- Bloch: Effective Java, 2nd Edition: http://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-Edition-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0321356683/
- Guava User Guide: https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/GuavaExplained
- Google's Java style guide: http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javaguide.html

We suggest to use Eclipse for development,
as several parts of this guide are incorporated into the Eclipse project configuration
(indentation, spaces instead of tabs, no trailing whitespaces).
If you do not use Eclipse, please ensure manually that you follow this guide,
or configure your editor/IDE to behave similarly.
Also Eclipse shows more warnings than javac, and these warnings should be taken care of.


Code Formatting:
- No tabs in source code!
- 2 spaces for indentation per level.
- No trailing white spaces.
- Do not use automatic code formatting of Eclipse for the complete code,
  it destroys a lot of meaningful manual formatting.
- A block is always surrounded by braces, e.g., if (...) { ...block... }.
- Before { and after } there is one space.
- The { is not on a new line.
- There is no white space between method/constructor name and parenthesis,
  but there is one space between between keywords and parenthesis. Example:
  func();
  if (...) { ... }
  for (...) { ... }
- There is no white space directly inside parentheses,
  except for aligning lines in multi-line conditions.
- There is one space after "," in parameter lists, and none before.
- The ":" in enhanced for loops has one space before and after it.
- When breaking long statements over multiple lines,
  think about indenting them in the following way:
  Object o = x.foo()
              .bar()
              .m();
  (especially for the builder pattern and FluentIterable).
- Aim for a line length of at maximum 80-100 characters.
- There is at least one blank line between methods and constructors,
  more to group related methods.
- There is no blank line required between fields,
  but there is between fields and other members,
  and between unrelated groups of fields.

Spelling:
- Try to avoid typos.
- Names are spelled camel-like, whereEachNewWordStartsWithCapital.
- Type names start with a capital.
- Method names start lower case and begin with a verb.
- Variable names start lower case.
  Parameters should start with 'p' to avoid confusion with
  local variables or fields.
- For a set of names of concepts (e.g., of files, classes),
  the prefix order induced by the names should
  represent the semantic relation and structure of the concepts.

Compilation:
- Never check in with compile errors.
- Avoid warnings:
  - If there is a way to fix the code, fix it (before committing).
  - Otherwise use @SuppressWarnings.
- Use Eclipse to check for warnings, it shows a lot more than javac.
- After adding/changing an @Option configuration,
  run "ant" to update documentation (before committing).

Version Control:
- Commit early, commit often, and
  split the commits into reasonable changesets.
- When re-formatting old code, do not mix this with other changes in a single commit.
- Try to have separate commits for bugfixes, refactorings, and new code.
- When renaming files, ensure that SVN recognizes this as a renaming
  in order to not disconnect the history (use SVN plugin for Eclipse,
  or "svn mv" on comand line). This is especially important for git-svn users.
- In order to avoid EOL problems caused by Unix/Windows/Mac, let's run
  find ./ -name "*" -exec svn propset svn:eol-style native {} \;
  from time to time.
- Set the svn:executable property only on files that need it (executables).
  On Linux this is done automatically, but Windows users should take care
  that this property is not added for all newly created files.

Design:
- Prefer immutable objects, for own classes and for collections
  (https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/ImmutableCollectionsExplained).
- Avoid null, replace it with real objects, or (at last resort) Optional:
  https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/UsingAndAvoidingNullExplained

Configuration options:
- Only use the @Option scheme so your options are automatically type-checked
  and documented.
- Only introduce an option when its meaningful
  (do not add options that nobody would ever want to change).
- Preferably use one of the existing prefixes
  (cpa.YOURCPA., analysis., parser., ...)
  instead of adding a new one.
- Do not use negated predicates as option name
  (use something.enable instead something.disable,
  something.foo instead of something.noFoo etc.).
- Do not forget to update the file doc/ConfigurationOptions.txt
  (done automatically by ant) and commit it together with your changes.

Coding:
- Never have public fields,
  never have non-private non-final fields,
  and try to keep all other non-private fields to a minimum.
- If you use null in method parameters or return values, annotate them with @Nullable.
- Mark fields as final, if they are never modified,
  and try to make them final, if they are modified (-> immutability).
- Prefer enhanced for-loop over List.get(int).
- Use arrays only with primitive types (int, long, etc.)
  or when existing APIs require them.
  Otherwise never use arrays of object types, use lists instead.
  They have a much nicer API, are equally fast,
  and allow you to use ImmutableList and Collections.unmodifiableList()
  to avoid the need for defensive copying while still guaranteeing immutability.
- Do not use the following classes from the JDK, they all have better replacements:
  Vector (replaced by ArrayList)
  Stack (replaced by Deque interface with implementations ArrayDeque and LinkedList)
  Hashtable (replaced by HashMap)
- The default list implementation is ArrayList (fast and memory-efficient),
  use LinkedList only if you need (i.e., when adding/removing elements in the middle of the list).
  When adding/removing elements at the start of the list, use ArrayDeque.
- When declaring variables of collection types,
  use the interface as type instead of the implementation (e.g., List instead of ArrayList).
  This is especially true for fields, parameters, and return types.
  Do use the Immutable* types from Guava, though, to show that your collection is immutable.
- Use Integer, Double, Long, Boolean etc. only when necessary (this is, inside generics like in List<Integer>).
  In fields, method parameters and return values, and local parameters,
  it is better to use the corresponding primitive types like int.
- Never call the constructor of Integer, Double, Long, Boolean, etc.!
  Use the valueOf() method, it may do caching.
- Never call the String constructor.
  Strings do not need copying, and for other uses there is the valueOf() method.
- Avoid Cloneable and clone(), use copy constructors instead if you need them
  (you don't if you use immutable classes).
- When using our LogManager, don't concatenate log messages with +,
  pass each part as a separate argument (concatenation will be done only if necessary).
- Never swallow an exception.
  If throwing another exception, add the original one as the cause.
  If logging, either use logUserException()
  (if the exception text should be shown to the user)
  or logDebugException() (in all other cases).
