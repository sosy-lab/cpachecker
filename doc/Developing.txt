CPAchecker Develop Instructions

More details (style guide etc.) can be found in the other files in this directory.


Develop CPAchecker from within Eclipse
--------------------------------------

1. Install Eclipse at least version 3.5, with JDT.
   http://www.eclipse.org/

2. Install an SVN plugin for Eclipse, e.g. SubClipse (http://subclipse.tigris.org,
   Eclipse update site: http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.6.x)
   Create new project from SVN repository
   URL: https://svn.sosy-lab.org/software/cpachecker/trunk
   URL (read-only mirror): http://cpachecker.googlecode.com/svn/trunk

3. Ignore warnings "Unsatisfied version constraint: 'org.eclipse.cdt.core ...'"
   and "Bundle 'org.eclipse.cdt.core' cannot be resolved'".

4. In order to run CPAchecker, use one of the supplied launch configurations
   or create your own.
   To select the configuration, specification, and program files use the
   text box "program arguments" in the launch configuration editor.
   Step 8 of the section "Running CPAchecker" above describes what can be entered here.
   The text box "VM arguments" needs to contain "-Djava.library.path=lib/native/<ENVIRONMENT>",
   where <ENVIRONMENT> is replaced with one of the following depending on your system:
   		x86_64-linux, x86-linux, x86_64-macosx, x86-macosx,  x86-win32

5. Optional:
   If you want the sources of the libraries (like Guava or CDT),
   run "ant install-contrib" once in the CPAchecker directory.


Develop CPAchecker as Eclipse Plugin for C projects
---------------------------------------------------

1. Requires Eclipse 3.5 with CDT 6 or Eclipse 3.6 with CDT 7
   and the Eclipse Plugin Development Environment.
   If you have CDT 6, you need the package "Eclipse C/C++ Development Tools SDK"
   (Eclipse update site: http://download.eclipse.org/tools/cdt/releases/galileo).
   If you have CDT 7, you need the package "Eclipse C/C++ Development Tools".
   Also install an SVN plugin, e.g. SubClipse (see above).

2. Create an Eclipse project for CPAchecker as described above.

3. Create an Eclipse project for CPAclipse from the SVN repository
   URL: https://svn.sosy-lab.org/software/cpachecker/trunk/plugin/CPAclipse

4. If there are warnings about missing bundles, you don't have CDT in the correct version.

5. Run the CPAclipse project as an "Eclipse Application".
