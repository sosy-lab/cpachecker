  /**
   * This method computes the nodes which are at the boundary between a condition and the nodes
   * inside two branches starting from it. This can be used to find out after which node one of the
   * branches has been definitely been selected.
   *
   * <p>To do this, first every node in the boundary of the condition is computed. These are all
   * nodes which are successors of edges in the condition but not predecessors, we call these
   * boundary condition nodes. If the first branch contains at least one node, the
   * intersection/difference of nodes which are a predecessor of an edge in the first branch with
   * the boundary condition nodes is taken to get the nodes between the condition and the first
   * branch/second branch. If the first branch is empty, the intersection/difference of the boundary
   * condition nodes with the nodes which are a predecessor of an edge in the second branch is taken
   * to get the nodes between the condition and the first branch/second branch.
   *
   * <p>
   *
   * <p>For example, consider the following graph for an if condition, where node 6 and 5 are the
   * first nodes in the 'then' and 'else' branches respectively. Then the nodes at the boundary are
   * 3 and 4, where 3 is at the boundary for the 'then' branch and 4 is at the boundary to the
   * 'else' branch.
