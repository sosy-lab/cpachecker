 *
 * @param conversionType How conversion of right-hand-side type to target type should be handled.
 * @param useOldSSAIndicesIfAliased Whether old SSA indices should be reused if the left-hand side
 *     is stored in aliased location. Intended to be used for initial assignment to a left-hand
 *     side, but cannot be used for subsequent assignments.
 * @param forceEncodingQuantifiers If set, quantifiers are encoded within the assignment even if
 *     they are not globally set to be encoded. Intended to be used for enabling quantification of
 *     some assignments while leaving others to be unrolled.
 * @param forcePointerAssignment If set, the left-hand side is treated as a pointer; the assignment
 *     caller is responsible for ensuring that the left-hand side type can be treated as such.
 *     Intended to be used for function parameters which may need to be assigned as a pointer even
 *     though their actual type is an array type. Cannot be set together with {@link
 *     #forceArrayAttachment}.
 * @param forceArrayAttachment If set, left-hand-side array address is attached to right-hand-side
 *     aliased location or value. It is up to caller to ensure that the left-hand side is an array
 *     and the right-hand side formula will be a memory address. Cannot be set together with {@link
