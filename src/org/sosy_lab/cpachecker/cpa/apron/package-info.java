/**
 * The Apron CPA is based on the APRON library. It can use octagons, intervals
 * or polyhedra (octagons were used during the implementation of this CPA).
 *
 * The octagon abstract domain is a weakly relational numerical domain. It is
 * based on Difference-Bound Matrices and therefore able to handle
 * constraints of the form <pre> ±X ±Y ≤ c</pre> with <pre>X</pre> and <pre>Y</pre> being variables
 * and <pre>c</pre> being a constant number in the range of the real numbers.  Thus it can be
 * seen as a more specific version of the polyhedron domain, which allows
 * the representation of linear constraints with an arbitrary number of variables.
 *
 * Please note that the used APRON library is the official successor of the Octagon Abstract Domain
 * Library (also added in CPAchecker c.f. OctagonCPA), so you might want to take a look at this CPA,
 * too, especially as its results where much more reliable than the ones of the ApronCPA.
 *
 * More information on this abstract domain, the implementation, and the evaluation of this CPA
 * can be found at: <b>http://stieglmaier.me/uploads/thesis.pdf</b>
