/**
 * This CPA should be used as wrapper-CPA.
 * It's location in the CPA-hierarchy should be between ARG- and Composite-CPA.
 * The transfer-relation calls the wrapped transfer-relation
 * as long as there is only/exactly one succeeding abstract state.
 * This can be beneficial for very special programs like RERS/ECA,
 * where long chains of abstract states are part of the CFA.
 *
 * The behavior is comparable with MultiEdges, but in contrast to them,
 * this CPA is not depending on chains in the CFA,
 * because the wrapped transfer-relation might be sufficient to exclude branches
 * and only traverse a chain of CFA-nodes.
