/**
 * The LiveVariablesCPA is a backwards program analysis, which is aimed to find out which
 * variable is live (read as used afterwards) at which position.
 * As the information is only complete after this CPA has finished computing live variables was
 * directly added into the preprocessing of CPAchecker and can be toggled with the option
 * <b>cfa.findLiveVariables</b> by default no live variables are generated.
 *
 * Up to now, in case of pointer aliasing this analysis is unsound.
