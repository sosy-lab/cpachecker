/**
 *  This package defines a CPA that determines the level of (non-)determism of a program,
 *  by inspecting how many assume edges can be evaluated to a concrete result, and how many not
 *  This should be a good indicator for whether using refinement for the value analysis or not
 *  (e.g. product lines are quite deterministic, and work very good without refinement,
 *  while it is the other way round for most ldv* tasks)
