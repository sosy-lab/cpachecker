/**
 * Post-processings for the CFA that change the CFA structure,
 * executed (optionally) between parsing and returning the finished CFA.
 *
 * Be careful when you want to add something here.
 * If possible, do not change the CFA,
 * but write you analysis such that it handles the unprocessed CFA.
 * If your analysis depends on a specifically post-processed CFA,
 * it may not be possible to combine it with other CPAs.
