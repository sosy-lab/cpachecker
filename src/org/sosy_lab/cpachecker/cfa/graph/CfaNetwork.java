/**
 * The graph representation of a CFA, without any summary edges.
 *
 * <p>Ignoring all summary edges, all connections between elements of a CFA (i.e., its nodes and
 * edges) are defined by a {@link CfaNetwork}. Depending on the implementation, the CFA represented
 * by a {@link CfaNetwork} may differ from the CFA represented by its individual elements (e.g.,
 * {@link CFAEdge#getSuccessor()} and {@link CfaNetwork#successor(CFAEdge)} may not return the same
 * value). It's important to only use methods provided by {@link CfaNetwork}, if more than a single
 * CFA node and/or edge is involved.
 *
 * <p>For performance reasons, some expensive checks are only performed if Java assertions are
 * enabled. Even though this is bad practice in general, this is also the case for some
 * preconditions. E.g., for some implementations, checking whether a CFA node or edge actually
 * belongs to a {@link CfaNetwork} can be quite expensive, so this isn't necessarily checked for all
 * method arguments, if Java assertions are disabled.
 *
 * <p>All returned sets are unmodifiable views, so modification attempts throw an exception.
 * However, modifications to a {@link CfaNetwork} will be reflected in its returned set views. A
 * {@link CfaNetwork} must not be modified while any of its set view are iterated, as this might
 * lead to incorrect iterations.
