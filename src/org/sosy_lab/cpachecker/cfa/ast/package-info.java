 * The classes that are used to represent single program statements, declarations,

 * Sub-packages contain language-specific sub-classes

 * The classes in this package have an "A" as prefix to show that they are
 * language-independent, in contrast to the language-specific classes
 * with prefixes like "C" and "J".
 * All classes in this package named "Abstract*" are only relevant
 * for implementing the language-specific sub-classes
