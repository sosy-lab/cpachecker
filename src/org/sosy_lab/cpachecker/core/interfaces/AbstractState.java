/**
 * An abstract state represents a set of concrete states in a specific abstract domain.
 *
 * Abstract states are produced by the operator of a {@link ConfigurableProgramAnalysis}.
 * They are typically not interpreted by other components than the CPA they belong to,
 * but an abstract state may implement some sub-interfaces of AbstractState or other interfaces
 * to allow some kind of information to be extracted from it.
 *
 * Abstract states should be immutable!
 *
 * If there is a fast way for an abstract state to check whether it might be covered
 * by some other state, consider implementing {@link Partitionable} such that
 * two abstract states that are in different partitions are guaranteed to never cover it each other.
 * This can be used with a partitioned reached set to speed up coverage checks.

   * Equality checks should be reasonably fast because they can be called very often,
   * for example if an abstract state is added to a set.
   *
   * Equality checks must be sound, but may be imprecise,
   * i.e., for two states s1 and s2 that represent the same set of concrete states,
   * {@code s1.equals(s2)} may return {@code false},
   * but if s1 and s2 represents different sets of concrete states,
   * {@code s1.equals(s2)} must never return {@code true}.
