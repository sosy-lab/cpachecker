   * Returns the key of the current object that indicates in which part of the

   * The result of this method:
   * - may be null
   * - must provide meaningful and consistent equals() and hashCode() implementations
   * - must stay constant regarding the relation defined by equals() throughout
   *   the whole lifetime of this object
   *
   * - needs not to stay constant regarding the object identity relation
   *   defined by the == operator
   * - should probably never be an array (they miss a meaningful equals() implementation),
   *   use an list instead
   *
   * There is no restriction on the number of different (regarding equals())
   * keys the objects of one class may have: It is legal for all objects to
   * have the same key as well as for all objects to have different keys.
   * In the former case this method might always return null.
   * In the latter case this method might for example return the current object
   * or the value of {@link Object#hashCode()} for the object (which may be
   * obtained by {@link System#identityHashCode(Object)} even if a superclass
   * overwrites hashCode()).
