 * {@link MergeSepOperator}, {@link MergeJoinOperator}.

  /**
   * The actual method for merging abstract states.
   * Merging abstract states is defined by weakening the state in the second parameter
   * by taking information from the state in the first parameter.
   *
   * This method may decide to not merge the states at all
   * (i.e., returning simply the state from the second input parameter),
   * or to join them by delegating to {@link AbstractDomain#join(AbstractState, AbstractState)},
   * or to somehow otherwise weaken the state from the second input parameter.
   * It may also decide to use any of these options only sometimes,
   * depending for example on the input states or the precision.
   * For trivial cases, check the default implementations of this class.
   *
   * For soundness, the resulting state needs to be as least as abstract
   * as the state in the second parameter,
   * i.e., state2 <= result <= top
   * (as defined by the {@link AbstractDomain#isLessOrEqual(AbstractState, AbstractState)} method).
   *
   * @param state1 The first input state.
   * @param state2 The second input state, from which the result is produced.
   * @param precision The precision.
   * @return An abstract state between state2 and the top state.
