/**
 * This class can be used to execute a separate process and read it's output in

 * and exit afterwards.
 *
 * This class is not thread-safe, it assumes that never two of it's methods are
 * executed simultaneously.
 *
 * When an instance of this class is created, the corresponding process is
 * started immediately. Then some text may be written to stdin of the process
 * with the {@link #println(String)} method. Afterwards {@link #join()} has to be
 * called, which reads the output from the process and calls the handle* methods.
 * This method blocks, i.e. when it returns the process has terminated. Now the
 * get* methods may be used to get the output of the process.
 *
 * @param <E> The type of the exceptions the handle* methods may throw.
