Changes from CPAchecker 1.2 to CPAchecker 1.3.4
-----------------------------------------------

Main changes:

* Conditional Model Checking (CMC)
  The flexibility of sequential combinations of analyses inside CPAchecker has been extended.
  A configuration based on this won two categories of SV-COMP'14
  and a silver medal in the category Overall
  (cf. http://sv-comp.sosy-lab.org/2014/results/).

* Symbolic Memory Graphs (SMG)
  An analysis that models the heap precisely as SMGs has been added
  and can be used for finding memory violations.
  It won the category MemorySafety of SV-COMP'14
  (cf. http://sv-comp.sosy-lab.org/2014/results/).

* Precision Reuse
  The explicit-value analysis and the predicate analysis have gained support for precision reuse,
  a technique that allows much faster regression verification,
  i.e., verification of a new version of a program
  (cf. "Precision Reuse for Efficient Regression Verification".
  Dirk Beyer, Stefan Löwe, Evgeny Novikov, Andreas Stahlbauer, and Philipp Wendler.
  In Proc. ESEC/FSE, ACM, 2013).

* Domain Types
  A suitable abstract domain can be selected automatically
  depending on the usage pattern of each variable,
  for example a BDD or explicit-value analysis
  (cf. "Domain Types: Abstract-Domain Selection Based on Variable Usage".
  Sven Apel, Dirk Beyer, Karlheinz Friedberger, Franco Raimondi, and Alexander von Rhein.
  In Proc. HVC, LNCS 8244, Springer, 2013).

* k-Induction
  A proof method based on k-Induction (using an SMT solver) has been added
  and can be combined with our bounded-model-checking implementation
  (config -bmc-induction).

* Predicate Analysis
  A much improved pointer handling is implemented and enabled by default.
  Furthermore, support for a bitprecise handling of all int variables has been added
  (including overflows and bitwise operators).
  This configuration is available as -predicateAnalysis-bitprecise.

* Google App Engine
  CPAchecker has been successfully ported to the Google App Engine,
  accessible via a web frontend (http://cpachecker.appspot.com) and a JSON API.

* Improved C Frontend
  Support for many additional C features has been added to CPAchecker.
  Pre-processing with CIL is not necessary any more.
  CPAchecker can be given several C files at once
  and links them together before verifying them as a single program.
  This simplifies verification of programs consisting of multiple source files.

* Experimental Java Support
  A Java frontend has been added to CPAchecker,
  and some analyses were extended to support verification of Java programs.
  This is still experimental and several language features are still missing
  (e.g., exceptions).


Further changes:

* Java 7 is required now.

* Specification
  Support for property files of the SV-COMP added, specify them with -spec <FILE.prp>
  (cf. http://sv-comp.sosy-lab.org/2014/rules.php)

* Configuration-File Changes:
  File names are now relative to the file in which they are given,
  several CPAs have been renamed (ABMCPA -> BAMCPA, ExplicitCPA -> ValueAnalysisCPA),
  many changes to other configuration options as well.
  If you use your own configuration files, you will need to adjust them
  (cf. doc/ConfigurationOptions.txt)

* Error Paths
  Multiple error paths can be searched and written to disk
  with the option "analysis.stopAfterError = false".
  More information about variable assignments has been added to the error paths.
  The use of the report generator has been simplified,
  just call scripts/report-generator.py (cf. doc/BuildReport.txt).

* SMT solvers for Predicate Analysis:
  SMTInterpol (http://ultimate.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/smtinterpol/index.html)
  is now well integrated.
  The support for MathSAT4 was dropped (MathSAT5 continues to be the default solver).

* Benchmarking Support
  CPAchecker provides scripts for benchmarking with large sets of programs.
  These have been extended and now provide more precise time and memory measurement
  (using Linux cgroups). Also the generated HTML tables have more features now.
  (cf. doc/Benchmark.txt)


Changes from CPAchecker 1.1 to CPAchecker 1.2
---------------------------------------------

CPAchecker now supports several new analyses:

* CEGAR for ExplicitCPA (as submitted to SV-COMP'13)
  (c.f. "Explicit-State Software Model Checking Based on CEGAR and Interpolation", to appear in FASE'13)
  This can be enabled with the "explicitAnalysis" and "explicitAnalysis-ItpRefiner*" configurations
  (explicitAnalysis-ItpRefiner-ABElf is recommended)

* Conditional Model Checking (CMC)
  (c.f. "Conditional Model Checking: A Technique to Pass Information between Verifiers", FSE'12)
  To use two or more CMC-enabled configurations, use the "-cmc" command-line argument:
  Example: -cmc explicitAnalysis-100s-generate-cmc-condition -cmc predicateAnalysis-use-cmc-condition

* Sequential composition of analyses (as submitted to SV-COMP'13)
  The "-cmc" command-line argument can be used for this, too.
  Example: -cmc explicitAnalysis-100s -cmc predicateAnalysis

* Predicate-based analysis using the Impact refinement strategy
  (c.f. "Algorithms for Software Model Checking: Predicate Abstraction vs. IMPACT", FMCAD'12)
  This can be enabled with the "predicateAnalysis-ImpactRefiner-*" configurations.

* BDD-based analysis tracking a subset of variables,
  with ExplicitCPA tracking the remaining variables.
  This can be enabled with the "explicit-BDD-*" configurations.

Other changes to CPAchecker:
* Pre-processing of C files with CIL is no longer needed.
* MathSAT5 is now used as as SMT solver by default.
  MathSAT4 can still be selected by setting the option
  cpa.predicate.solver=Mathsat4
* In configuration files, #include directives can be used
  to include other configuration files.
* The file format of the file with the initial set of predicates
  (option cpa.predicate.abstraction.initialPredicates) and
  the final set of predicates (option cpa.predicate.predmap.file) was changed.
  It is now the same format for both files, and based on the SMTlib2 format.
  See doc/examples/predmap.txt for an example.
* The option cpa.predicate.machineModel was renamed to analysis.machineModel.
* The Cudd BDD library was removed, now JavaBDD's implementation is used by default
  (it has similar performance, but more features).
* The ARTCPA was renamed to ARGCPA.
  Replace cpa.art with cpa.arg and ARTCPA with ARGCPA in existing configuration files.
* The option analysis.traversal.useTopsort (used in most configuration files)
  was renamed to analysis.traversal.useReversePostorder as this name is more precise.
* SMTInterpol, an SMT solver written in Java, is now integrated into CPAchecker.
  With this solver, predicate analysis works on all platforms.
  Some configuration options were renamed in order to not be MathSAT-specific.
* The log level for the console can now be adjusted during runtime.
  Use a JMX client to do that, e.g., jconsole or VisualVM.
  Connect to the CPAchecker process,
  locate the MXBean "org.sosy_lab.common:type=LogManager",
  and set the attribute.
* The option "cpa.removeIrrelevantForErrorLocations" was renamed to
  "cfa.removeIrrelevantForSpecification", as this name is more appropriate.
* A time limit of 15 minutes is now enabled by default in most configurations.
  If the analysis is not yet finished, CPAchecker will stop after this time and report UNKNOWN.
  The time limit can be controlled with the "cpa.conditions.global.time.wall" option
  and the "-timelimit" command-line argument.
  Example:
  scripts/cpa.sh -predicateAnalysis -timelimit 1min test.c
* If the #include directive of specification automata is used with relative paths,
  the base directory of the relative path is now the directory of the file which contains the #include,
  not the CPAchecker root directory.
  If #include is used with relative paths in a specification file, it most probably needs adjustment.
