# This is a Docker image for running the Javascript end-to-end tests.
# It should be pushed to registry.gitlab.com/sosy-lab/software/cpachecker/test
# and will be used by CI as declared in .gitlab-ci.yml.
#
# Commands for updating the image:
# docker build --pull -t registry.gitlab.com/sosy-lab/software/cpachecker/test:java-node - < build/gitlab-ci.Dockerfile.java-node
# docker push registry.gitlab.com/sosy-lab/software/cpachecker/test

# We base it on Ubuntu 20.04 instead of some Node image
# to make sure that the tests are also executable on a standard Ubuntu easily.
FROM ubuntu:20.04
